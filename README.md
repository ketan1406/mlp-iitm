## Assignments 📂

Here’s what you can expect:

1. **Data Preprocessing** 🛠️
   - Learn how to handle missing data, scale features, and encode categorical variables. These skills are the foundation of any ML pipeline.

2. **Supervised Learning** 🎯
   - Get hands-on with algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. Each has its own strengths, and you'll learn when to use what.

3. **Unsupervised Learning** 🔍
   - Dive into clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. Great for finding hidden patterns in data!

4. **Model Evaluation and Optimization** 📊
   - Understand how to evaluate your models with cross-validation, tune their hyperparameters, and use metrics to measure success.

5. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning** *(Optional)* 🌐
   - Ready for a challenge? Explore the basics of neural networks, including forward and backpropagation.
